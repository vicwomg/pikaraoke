Docker users can use this set of configuration files to deploy pikaraoke on a server.

Prerequisites:
1. Docker-ce must already be installed and configured on the server.
2. The server must have Internet access, because the Docker image will be downloaded during the first launch, and then ytub-dl will be downloaded periodically and, if desired, the search on youtube.com will work with further downloading of the found songs.


Installation:
1. Download the docker/pikaraoke folder to any convenient folder on the server. For example, to /opt/pikaraoke. I assume you have done so.
2. Go to this folder and specify the location for song files. 

By default, songs will be stored in the /opt/piraraoke/pikaraoke-songs folder.
If desired, you can create a symbolic link to the actual location or edit the MEDIADIR variable in the /opt/pikaraoke/env file

3. Run the /opt/pikaraoke/bin/docker.run script in the terminal. 

The system will start, and you can check that it is working. 
The log will be directly in the terminal. If there are errors, view and edit the variables in the /opt/pikaraoke/env file
To exit pikaraoke, type ctrl-c.

Once you have verified that everything is working, run the script /opt/pikaraoke/bin/gen_systemd_service. It will generate a service file that can be added to startup.
